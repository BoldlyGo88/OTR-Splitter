# OTR-Splitter
Python script that splits .otr files for compatability on the Nintendo Switch

## Space warning
.otr files can get bigger once split and I currently don't know a way to fix it/why its happening/or im overlooking something on my end, so until then this warning will have to do

## Prerequisites

  - Plenty of free space on your Switch
  - [Retro](https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro)
  - [OoT-Reloaded Source Files](https://github.com/GhostlyDark/OoT-Reloaded-SoH/tree/master/OoT%20Reloaded%20(SoH)) (or any other .OTR source exceeding 4GB)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Creating the .otr's for the Switch

1. Navigate to the OoT-Reloaded Source directory (OoT-Reloaded-SoH-master\OoT Reloaded (SoH)) (or whatever you have)
2. Download or copy the python script into the source directory and launch it
3. Enter a value between 1000 and 1500, for the precompiled .otrs i've supplied I used 1350.
5. Wait for everything to finish and get the newly created directories ready
6. Open Retro and Press "Create OTR"
7. Press "Replace Textures" and then press "Yes", select any of the new directories from step 5
8. When loaded press "Stage Textures" and wait for it to complete
9. Finally press Finalize OTR and Generate OTR
10. Transfer to your Ship of Harkinian mods folder
